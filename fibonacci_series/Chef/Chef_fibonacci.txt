Ice Cream a la Fibonacci.

This delicious recipe yields 1 serving of cinnamon ice cream if the serving is big enough.
Please make sure not to add the mashed banana all at once but in multiple steps (as described). This will improve the consistency of the ice cream.
Personal Note by the chef: I recommend executing this recipe at https://tio.run/#chef if you don't have a Chef interpreter at hand. An input of n will give you the (n+2)th Fibonacci number.
